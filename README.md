# Horiseon

## Description
This is the refactored source code for Horiseon Social Solution Service's website. It was built to boost their online presence and allows them to promote the services and benefits they offer. I learned that the previous version of the website was missing some basic accessibility features and could use several other improvements. This version of the website contains refactored HTML code that utilizes semantic elements and focuses on accessibility. The CSS was also consolidated to make the code simpler and more concise.
